The provided data consists of financial transactions recorded on different dates with information about the client, contact person, department, region, payment method, revenue, profit, and profit margin. The data spans from May 30, 2023, to June 2, 2023.

I utilized a pivot table to analyze and filter the information based on the Department and Region columns. The pivot table allowed me to specifically focus on Payment, Revenue, and Profit metrics across different departments (such as Cloud Tech, Strategy, Operations, and Big Data) and regions (Texas, New York, Florida, and California). This approach provides a structured and organized view of the financial data, enabling a detailed analysis of the company's performance in each department and region. Check attached file.
